# Bi-directional-Machine-Translation
Mini-Project : Created RNN Based deep learning system for efficient language translation.
**OBJECTIVE :-**
  **1. Language Mastery with RNNs:**

    IMDB dataset in torchtext.
    Markov to LSTM language model transformation.
    Track training progress with epoch/iteration plots.
    Impactful design choices and their effects on speed and quality.
  **2.Bi-directional Translation Duel:**
    Train Model 1 for language A to English.
    Train Model 2 (GloVe 100D) for English to language A.
    Input 5 English sentences into Model 2, then Model 1.
    Witness the magic of translation mastery.
